		<h1>After School Programs!</h1>
		<h2>What is it you may ask?</h2>
		<p>Nerd Street Gamers is offering after school programs at Localhost this fall to gamers seeking fun and personal development through video games and esports.  
		Twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays, participants will have the opportunity to play their favorite games with new and old friends 
		and learn valuable life skills within a safe, curated environment.</p>

		<h3>Video Games Camp</h3>
		<p>Camp Localhost, powered by Nerd Street Gamers, takes a unique approach to competitive gaming through online and in-person esports and video game camps.
		The biggest differentiator for our esports programs is our staff and our play-centric approach to teaching.
